<h3 align='center'>BRAINSTATION CAPSTONE PROJECT</h3>

## :video_game: OVERVIEW
**Purpose:** To create a content-based and user behaviour-based Steam game recommendation system using machine learning techniques. 

Steam is a digital platform to purchase and store digital copies of games that can then be easily accessed on the same platform alongside social features (such as online cooperative gameplay, friends lists, chatting, etc). There are anywhere from 10 to 20 million daily active users at any time, and at its peak, there have been almost 30 million users online at once. With around 80 to 90 thousand products (including software, games, DLC, etc) currently available and an exponentially growing number year over year, it becomes ever more difficult to decide where to invest a limited amount of gaming time. 

The sheer diversity of information associated with individual games (from genre, point of view, type (visual novels, role playing games, first person shootersâ€”to name a few)) lends itself to be a problem for big data and machine learning. Add onto that millions of players with unique player stats (games owned, reviews, playtime, etc), and there is an overwhelmingly large amount of data that can be worked with. 

## :100: WORK IN PROGRESS
|Phase of Analysis|Description of Work|Notebook|
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
|1. Data Collection|Sourcing from multiple data resources for Steam game data, recommendations by users and user statistics. Steam API, SteamSpy API and SteamDB are the primary sources of all information.|Notebook Part 1|
|2. Data Processing|Cleaning the acquired data with the intent to preserve as much game data as possible.|Notebook Part 1 & 2|
|3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations|Checking out individual features/categories/columns and visualization notable insights.|Notebook Part 2|
|4. Basic Modeling|A look into basic recommendation systems using user independent systems relying solely on popularity/scoring metrics and modeling using cosine similarity to find games with similar content.|Notebook Part 3A|
|5. Advanced Modeling|Experimental hybrid system using K-Means clustering into cosine similarity, and a brief look into FunkSVD|Notebook Part 3B & 4|
|6. Model Evaluation|Checking out accuracy of FunkSVD|Notebook Part 3B & 4|
